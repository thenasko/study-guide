Qual study guide
===========

This is a set of notes prepared while studying for the mathematics qualifying examination at Harvard University. The material appearing on the exam consists of six subjects: real analysis, complex analysis, algebra, algebraic topology, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. A typical exam consists of three 3-hour papers, each containing one problem from each of the six sections. For more details regarding the format of the qualifying exam, please see [this](http://math.harvard.edu/graduate/index.html#qualifying).

Work on this document started during the summer of 2010 with the goal to prepare study guide for each of the six subjects, as well as solutions to some past problems. Currently there are notes on only five of the subjects (all except differential geometry), and even within these, there is a lot of room for improvement.

I hope someone will peope who are currently studying for a mathematics qualifying exam will find this guide helpful. While the structure of the document follows the exam at Harvard, many other departments have written or oral exams in similar scope. Please contribute to this project so we can improve its present form.
