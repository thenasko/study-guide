{"name":"Study-guide","tagline":"Harvard mathematics qualifying examination study guide","body":"Qual study guide\r\n===========\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis is a set of notes prepared while studying for the mathematics qualifying examination at Harvard University. The material appearing on the exam consists of six subjects: real analysis, complex analysis, algebra, algebraic topology, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. A typical exam consists of three 3-hour papers, each containing one problem from each of the six sections. For more details regarding the format of the qualifying exam, please see [this page](http://math.harvard.edu/graduate/index.html#qualifying).\r\n\r\nWork on this document started during the summer of 2010 with the goal to prepare study guides for each of the six subjects, as well as solutions to some past problems. Currently there are notes on only five of the subjects (all except differential geometry); even within these, there is a lot of room for improvement.\r\n\r\nI hope people who are currently studying for a mathematics qualifying exam will find this document helpful. While the structure of the document follows Harvard's syllabus, many other departments have similar in scope written or oral exams.\r\n\r\nA current version of the guide can be downloaded from [here](http://math.harvard.edu/~nasko/documents/study_guide.pdf).\r\n\r\nPlease contribute to this project so we can improve its present form.\r\n\r\nCompilation\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nYou can compile the notes to PDF format by executing the following command in the root of the project.\r\n\r\n`$ pdflatex Study_Guide.tex`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
